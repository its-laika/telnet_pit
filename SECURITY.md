## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to report a vulnerability, check if it's possible to create an issue
without endangering other users. If that's not the case, send a mail to the
address on my ([its-laika](https://github.com/its-laika)) profile. I check my
mails pretty frequently so expect a reply within a few days. From there on, I'll
do my best to fix the vulnerability asap. If you want to, you can also provide
patches directly or via pull requests. An update is pushed as soon as the
vulnerability is fixed.
